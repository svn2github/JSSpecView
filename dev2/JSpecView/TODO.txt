bug:
If I open an XML file then open another XML file then open another XML file
The drop down file type always defaults to JCAMP-DX (not a problem)
BUT instead of it showing 1 JDX type it keeps on increasing in the
list so jcamp-dx shows up 3 times
and every time I open another XML it seems to add another jcamp-dx to
the drop down file type list.
