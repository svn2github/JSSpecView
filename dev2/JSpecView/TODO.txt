t6a.jdx  -- MS Relative Abundance is x 10 
t6a.jdx  -- NMR -- no need for scale on left?

DONE -- file save -- includes Models but not Peaks 

file close in application does not change tree.


in JDXSource.java I have commented out:

//    if (label.equals("##PATHLENGTH")) {
//      jdxObject.pathlength = value;
//      return true;
//    }

    // NOTE: returning TRUE for these means they are 
    // not included in the header map -- is that what we want?
    
//    if(label.equals("##MINX") ||
//        label.equals("##MINY") ||
//        label.equals("##MAXX") ||
//        label.equals("##MAXY") ||
//        label.equals("##FIRSTY")||
//        label.equals("##DELTAX") ||
//        label.equals("##DATACLASS"))
//        return true;



That was setting pathlength but never reading it, and the others were being ignored
completely instead of being saved in the Hashtable. Don't we want those in the spectrum hashtable?
