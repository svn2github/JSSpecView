With Jmol application, when loading a Block file the JSV display is automatically showing the LAST Block.

> That's the design -- you want first?


Clicking on the Jmol display shows the peaks, using the Jmol Menu under Spectra gives the hover display
Selecting an option though gives no change to the JSV display and that Block is not made the front display.

> good idea; no mechanism to do that at present


Loading a Block file and switching between Blocks without selecting a peak.
Having looked at 4 Blocks and returning to the first.
A PEAK is shown selected and if an IR then Jmol starts vib mode despite not having clicked in the JSV display.

> fixed? I'm not seeing that.


Loading acetophenone.html and selecting a peak in the IR sends the display into frenzy
with overlay showing and uncontrollable flashing between spectra.
Seems to happen as well when you select a peak then use spectrumnumber to change display

> probably fixed.


Jmol menu. HNMR and CNMR now showing but only hover works.
Clicking on an option does not give the highlight in the JSV display
Clicking on a peak in the H or C NMR works

> needs design change.


Dialog Box for overlay colours needs checking

> overlay keys are working, but they are strange. Switching between 
frames is not working right  -- just turns off the key entirely.

=====DONE========

Use of Ctrl-/ Ctrl+
OK for when baseline is at the bottom, needs to work as well for spectra 
where the baseline is at the top of the page 

DONE for a block file allow overlaying some of the spectra not necessarily all the spectra

  command:   OVERLAY 1.1,1.2 for instance

6th Mar turn off RED error icon when file is closed.
Done

bug:
If I open a file then open another file then open another file
The drop down file type in the file open dialog box always defaults to JCAMP-DX (not a problem)
BUT instead of it showing 1 JDX type it keeps on increasing in the
list so jcamp-dx shows up 3 times
and every time I open another file it seems to add another jcamp-dx to
the drop down file type list.

done 8.3.12
