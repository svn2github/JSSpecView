compoundmenuon true gives menu option of Spectra
compoundmenuon false gives greyed out menu option of Blocks

ReversePlot was disabled; x widgets aren't right with plot reversed.

With JSpecView application, loading a file gives the dialog box and if you sort on date the program crashes.

Clicking on the Jmol display shows the peaks, using the Jmol Menu under Spectra gives the hover display
Selecting an option though gives no change to the JSV display and that Block is not made the front display.
Jmol menu. HNMR and CNMR now showing but only hover works.
Clicking on an option does not give the highlight in the JSV display
Clicking on a peak in the H or C NMR works

> good idea; no mechanism to do that at present

Dialog Box for overlay colours needs checking

> overlay keys are working, but they are strange. Switching between 
frames is not working right  -- just turns off the key entirely.

=====DONE========

GC/MS is not tested and probably all messed up.
Works if call is to the GCMS.jdx file with overlay ALL

With Jmol application, when loading a Block file the JSV display is automatically showing the LAST Block.
>Changed to display First Block


With a dual display of GC at top and MS at bottom what script should I use to
change the lower display but leaving the top display undisturbed?
Can they be identified individually?

> done:
For the applet
overlay 1,3 or 1,4 etc default display is overlay 1,2

  peak ms model1
  peak ms "204"  -- could look for match in title text?
> DONE -- needs testing

  peak ms "204" ALL
       -- added ALL keyword lets you look through  all spectra, otherwise it's just the current panel
       -- current panel, though, is always checked first.


Loading a Block file and switching between Blocks without selecting a peak.
Having looked at 4 Blocks and returning to the first.
A PEAK is shown selected and if an IR then Jmol starts vib mode despite not having clicked in the JSV display.

> fixed

Loading acetophenone.html and selecting a peak in the IR sends the display into frenzy
with overlay showing and uncontrollable flashing between spectra.
Seems to happen as well when you select a peak then use spectrumnumber to change display

>> fixed 

Integration should be standard size without changing when you scale Y

Use of Ctrl-/ Ctrl+
OK for when baseline is at the bottom, needs to work as well for spectra 
where the baseline is at the top of the page 

DONE for a block file allow overlaying some of the spectra not necessarily all the spectra

  command:   OVERLAY 1.1,1.2 for instance

6th Mar turn off RED error icon when file is closed.
Done

bug:
If I open a file then open another file then open another file
The drop down file type in the file open dialog box always defaults to JCAMP-DX (not a problem)
BUT instead of it showing 1 JDX type it keeps on increasing in the
list so jcamp-dx shows up 3 times
and every time I open another file it seems to add another jcamp-dx to
the drop down file type list.

done 8.3.12
